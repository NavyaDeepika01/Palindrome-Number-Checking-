# Palindrome-Number-Detector

A number that remains same even if its digits are reversed, is called a palindromic number. Example: 010, 101, 1001, 0110 etc...

Given an input (din), output (dout) a 1 if its binary representation is a palindrome and a 0 otherwise.

A palindrome binary representation means that the binary representation has the same sequence of bits whether you read it from left to right or right to left. Leading 0s are considered part of the input binary representation.
Input and Output Signals

    din - Input value
    dout - 1 if the binary representation is a palindrome, 0 otherwise


Example: 


Input: 32'b01111000011010100101011000011110

Output = 1
